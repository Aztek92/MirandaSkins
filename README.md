## Miranda NG configuration:
Since a lot depends on your miranda configuration i recommend you to change few things for better looks. It's something that i can't provide in file sadly.
* Open container option (rmb on msg window) and uncheck things you want, i also recommend you to switch to tabs on right side.
* Show tabs only if necessary
* Change font to one that suits you, but remember about colors (especially when it comes to clist_modern). Box in msg container color is (160/0/35||37/37/37)
* Remember to move profile pic (avatar) to 1st place in 'Objects in the row' in 'Contact List'
* Use overlay on avatar with status icon
* Using BBCode in IEView is rather recommended
